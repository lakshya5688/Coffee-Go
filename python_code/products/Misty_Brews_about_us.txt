Welcome to Misty Brews, your cozy coffee retreat nestled on the iconic Mall Road in Mussoorie.

At Misty Brews, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a moment of warmth, and a way to connect with others amidst the serene beauty of the hills.

Our Story  
Founded in 2015, Misty Brews was born out of a love for the misty mornings and tranquil charm of Mussoorie. What started as a small family-owned café has grown into a beloved destination for both locals and travelers alike.

Our journey began with a simple vision: to bring people together over ethically sourced, high-quality coffee. Inspired by the fresh mountain air and the slow, peaceful rhythm of life in the hills, we work closely with small coffee farms in India and beyond, ensuring that every cup we serve reflects care, craftsmanship, and sustainability. Our beans are roasted in-house, preserving the distinct flavors of the regions they come from, and each brew tells a story of passion and dedication.

Delivery & Locations Served  
While we invite you to relax and unwind in our warm and welcoming café, we also deliver to nearby locations, including Landour, Barlowganj, and Camel’s Back Road. Whether you're enjoying a quiet moment in your cottage, working remotely, or taking in the scenic views from a hillside bench, Misty Brews ensures your favorite cup of coffee is never out of reach.

Our Menu  
Our menu is crafted for all kinds of coffee lovers, from rich espresso blends to smooth cold brews, handcrafted teas, and freshly baked treats sourced from local bakeries. We cater to a variety of dietary needs, offering plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks to ensure there’s something for everyone.

Community & Sustainability  
Misty Brews is more than just a café—it’s a part of the Mussoorie experience. We are deeply committed to sustainability, using eco-friendly packaging, supporting local artisans, and minimizing our carbon footprint. Our café frequently hosts events like poetry readings, live acoustic sessions, and art exhibits, making it a vibrant hub for creativity and culture in the hills.
